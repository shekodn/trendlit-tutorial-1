# To Be Determined
Here you can find some incognitas that we had through the development of the project:
- ~~How to not care about the order in our html. What comes first? A text or an embedded element inside HTML~~ (SOLVED)
- Can we take the luxury of not using ```;```? (TBD)
- In the Grammar: What is the difference between embed and script block? Shall we repeat ourselves and have almost the same grammars for both: script and block? (TBD)

### Should we accept the following?
- Variables:
-- Declaration: int a = b = c (TBD)
-- int a, b, c (TBD)
-- Declare global vars in any part of the code or only at the top? (TBD)
-- Should vars be inside an statement? (TBD)
